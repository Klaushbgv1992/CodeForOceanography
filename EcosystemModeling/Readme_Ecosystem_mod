EcoSystem_modeling.py is based on the Lokta and Voltera model to estimate populations of predators (N2) and prey (N1). 

NOTE: 
	The simplified relationship is modelled using differential equations:
	->dN1/dt = b x N1 – K1 x N1 x N2
	->Change of prey   = prey increase – predation
	->dN2/dt = K2 x N1 x N2 – d x N2
	->Change of predator = catch of prey – predator death

	x is multiplication, 
	b is birth – death rate of prey, 
	d the death rate of predators. 
	K1 and K2 are constants
