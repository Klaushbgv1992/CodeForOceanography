Script to solve the heat equation with seasonal temperature forcing.

Figure 1 shows the number of iterations required to reach a reliable estimate of the temperature field. It shows that the model iterated the full number of times (500) until reaching a good convergence. The annual temperature cycle of the vertical temperature gradient is seen in figures 2 & 3. The Maximum surface temperature occurs in September and the minimum in March. This is delayed from the annual maximum and minimum air temperature due to the time it takes water to absorb heat. The thermocline (the region where temperature changes drastically with depth), is located between 8 and 10m. Over summer and autumn months the temperature decreases with depth whereas over winter and spring it increases with depth. 

Figure 4 shows how this annual heat cycle penetrates the lake. The amplitude is lower in the deeper part and higher in the upper part. The upper part is in direct contact with the atmosphere and its annual temperature variations, it therefore experiences a more variable influx and outflux of heat. As we move down in depth the cycle becomes more shifted in a positive direction and less variable (lower amplitude). The 10m maximum temperature occurs in March compared to the 1m maximum which occurs in November. Below 10m no annual temperature cycle exists.  

Note: The amplitude of the surface boundary condition can be changed by setting variable “TAMP” to x °C
